This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Famicom game Ripple Island.

The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC.

Get a ROM image of the original game. This should be the No-Intro verified dump
("Lipple Island (Japan).nes") with an iNES header; the MD5 sum should be
1c4434d47e58a41ed3752fd2bd4fc916. Rename it "ripple.nes" and place it in the
"ripple" folder. Then:

$ cd ripple
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as ripple_en.nes.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.
